[Embedded C Fundamentals](https://github.com/Sigma-eLabs/Embedded-C-Fundamentals) is focusing on helping you get familiar with embedded programming world step-by-step.

By having the fudamental knowledge about the embedded C, will enable you to have below skills:
* Deeply understand inside of the source code
* Confidently write your own code
* Able to debug the software and analyse the software issue
* Design and develop a robustness software
* Support you develop embedded programming skills, which is strong demanded by customers and employers

The topics may be simple, but I believe that every topic I bring here is a step-stone enable you to approach the much higher complex technical topics in embedded programming world and help you develop your career path!

# Requisitions
The below requistions are used for demostration only. For your case, you can choose another setup and implement the idea provided in the examples.
## Hardware
Development Kits used in the most of topics:
* [STM32 Nucleo-64 Development Board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html). The main microcontroller on the development kit is ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit produced by ST. Moreover, there is on-board ST-LINK programmer/debugger that enable user quickly flashes and debugs easily.

* [Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit - EK-TM4C123GXL](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL). The main microcontroller on the development kit is ARM Cortex-M4F 32-bit produced by Texas Instruments. Moreover, there is on-board Debugger/Programmer (Stellaris ICDI) that enable user quickly flashes and debugs easily.

Additionally, during testing và debugging, I also use Logic Analyzer to measure and capture the signal of microcontroller input/output pins.

## Software
[Keil C](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm) is an IDE developed by ARM company. It is a very powerful tool supports software engineer to compose, edit, compile, flash code and debug. Especially, with non-comercial version, I think it fully supports all your needs to study and research.

To visualize the measured signals of microcontroller pins from Logic Analyzer and easy to analyze the logs, [Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/pages/downloads) tool is one of the suitale choice.
